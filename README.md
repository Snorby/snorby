## Description

Snorby is a ruby on rails web application for network security monitoring that interfaces with current popular intrusion detection systems (Snort, Suricata and Sagan). The basic fundamental concepts behind Snorby are **simplicity**, organization and power. The project goal is to create a free, open source and highly competitive application for network monitoring for both private and enterprise use.

## Requirements

* Snort
* Ruby >= 1.9.2
* Rails >= 3.0.0

## Install

* Get Snorby from the download section or use the latest edge release via git.

	`git clone git://github.com/Snorby/snorby.git`

* Move into de snorby Directory

	`cd snorby`

* Install Gem Dependencies  (make sure you have bundler installed: `gem install bundler`)

	`$ bundle install`
	
	* NOTE: If you get missing gem issues in production use `bundle install --path vendor/cache`

	* If your system gems are updated beyond the gemfile.lock you should use as an example `bundle exec rake snorby:setup` 

	* If running `bundle exec {app}` is painful you can safely install binstubs by `bundle install --binstubs` 
	
* Install wkhtmltopdf

	`pdfkit --install-wkhtmltopdf # If this fails - visit http://wkhtmltopdf.org/ for more information`

* Run The Snorby Setup

	`rake snorby:setup`
	
* Edit The Snorby Configuration File

	`config/snorby_config.yml`
	
* Edit The Snorby Mail Configurations

	`config/initializers/mail_config.rb`
	
* Once all options have been configured and snorby is up and running

	* Make sure you start the Snorby Worker from the Administration page.
	* Make sure that both the `DailyCache` and `SensorCache` jobs are running.
	
* Default User Credentials

	* E-mail: **snorby@example.com**
	* Password: **snorby**
	
* NOTE - If you do not run Snorby with passenger (http://www.modrails.com) people remember to start rails in production mode.

	`rails -e production`
	
## Updating Snorby

In the root Snorby directory type the following command:

	`git pull origin master`
	
Once the pull has competed successfully run the Snorby update rake task:

	`rake snorby:update`
	
# Helpful Commands

You can open the rails console at anytime and interact with the Snorby environment. Below are a few helpful commands that may be useful:

 * Open the rails console by typing `rails c` in the Snorby root directory
 * You should never really need to run the below commands. They are all available within the
	Snorby interface but documented here just in case.

**Snorby Worker**

	Snorby::Worker.stop      # Stop The Snorby Worker
	Snorby::Worker.start     # Start The Snorby Worker
	Snorby::Worker.restart   # Restart The Snorby Worker

**Snorby Cache Jobs**
	
	# This will manually run the sensor cache job - pass true or false for verbose output
	Snorby::Jobs::SensorCacheJob.new(true).perform`

	# This will manually run the daily cache job - once again passing true or false for verbose output
	Snorby::Jobs::DailyCacheJob.new(true).perform

	# Clear All Snorby Cache - You must pass true to this method call for confirmation.
	Snorby::Jobs.clear_cache

	# If the Snorby worker is running this will start the cache jobs and set the run_at time for the current time.
	Snorby::Jobs.run_now!
