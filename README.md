## Description

Snorby is a ruby on rails web application for network security monitoring that interfaces with current popular intrusion detection systems (Snort, Suricata and Sagan). The basic fundamental concepts behind Snorby are **simplicity**, organization and power. The project goal is to create a free, open source and highly competitive application for network monitoring for both private and enterprise use.
